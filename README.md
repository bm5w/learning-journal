This is a basic web application for a learning journal.
Unauthorized users can view a list of entries and click a set link to
view the entry in detail. Authorized users can add and edit entries.
App will apply and display markdown syntax and code highlighting on entry text.
Authorized users can access a twitter button, that will automatically formulate
a tweet with the entry Title and link to the detail page.
Adding and editing entries does not require a redirect and dynamically updates
the page without reload, using Ajax.
