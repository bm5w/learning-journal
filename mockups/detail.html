        <p>Your Task
Create a Repository in GitHub called learning-journal.  The repository should have a README.md file and a standard Python .gitignore file. Clone the repository to your development machine. In the repository, create a new folder called mockups. In that folder, create four HTML files and a CSS stylesheet with the following specifications:

The first should be a home page that shows a list of journal entries with just the title and date created.
The second should be a detail page that shows a single entry.  The title, text and created date should be displayed on this page.
The third should be an HTML form page you will use to create a new entry.  The title and text of the entry should be inputs in this form, empty at first.
The fourth should be an HTML form page you will use to edit an existing entry.  The title and text of the entry should be inputs in this form as well, pre-populated with the text from an entry.
Each entry in the list on the home page should have a link that leads to the detail page.
The home page should also have a UI element that allows you to start to create a new entry. It should like to the create form page.
The detail page should have a UI element that allows editing the entry.  It should link to the edit form page.
There should be a UI element that leads back to the home page from anywhere in the site.
You should make an effort to make the pages in your mockup look as unified as possible.  Ensure that there is a common header, footer and navigation system shared among all the pages.

You must also include a CSS stylesheet in your repository that contains the styles needed to display the site.  The HTML mockup pages should use this stylesheet via a "link" tag in the HTML head section.</p>
